Documentation Required:

ANCurrentDrivenSpikes - should this be a module?
Cardio, CardioPressureFeedback, CardioVentricularDriver - Did Dave Anderson release these?
ToddIC - don't release until published

Minor revisons required:
Double-Check functionality of non-specific afferents (NSAs) in VoigtDCNCell
Incorporate NSAs into the documentation. 

New Documentation Completed:

MSOXCorr and MSOCombiner (revised Dec 2010 including sample stepsize)
GlobularBushyCell2

Revisions completed:

CaiIC2, BrugheraMSO2 and BushyCell2 -  
(Described default, Response Type = 0, which then defaults to conductances for Type2
individual max conductances can be set without specfying ResponseType = 0)

CaiIC and CaiIC2, BushyCell2, BrugheraMSO2 revised TauAHP to 1/sampleRate_Hz (check all modules) 

AuditoryNerveIFR (find a place to store this description, add to AuditoryNerveIFR on EarDev):
Externalized parameters v0, ks, which determine the Calcium activation, p
at the input to the two-stage depletion model of the AN synapse.
%
% Ca++ activation p is a sigmoid function 
% that varies between 0 and 1 as a function of Vin:
% p = 1./(1 + exp(1).^(2*ks*(v0-Vin))) .
% Parameter v0 sets the Vin value at which p = 0.5.
% Parameter ks sets the steepness of p as a function of Vin.
% For Vin = 0, p = 1/(1 + exp(2*ks*v0)).
%
% CaActivationP.m script (from Andrew Brughera) 
% calculates and plot the Ca++ activation, p, 
% for examples of low to high spontaneous rate AN fibers.
% Based on the voltage input Vin (in millivolts) from the InnerHairCell module. 
% Ca++ activation is the first stage of the auditory nerve synapse model
% (The AGC Model in Section 1.2.3. of Socrates Deligeorges dissertation).
