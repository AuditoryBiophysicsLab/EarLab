Thank you for installing the EarLab simulation and analysis suite.  
This software is produced and maintained by the Boston University Hearing Research Center, 
and is supported by grants from the National Institute of Deafness and 
Communication Disorders (NIDCD).  
This guide is intended to help you get started using EarLab as quickly as possible.

After installing the software, if you've selected the "Launch EarLab Experiment Manager" 
option at the end of the setup process, you will see the following window. 
If you haven't selected that option, you may run EarLab from 
<b>Start->All Programs->EarLab->Desktop EarLab->EarLab Experiment Manager</b> The EarLab 
Experiment Manager window looks like this:

To run the first simulation, <b>right click</b> on the first item in the window, 
here titled "Normal AN 500 Hz Level Series Experiment".  This will cause a menu to 
pop up, and allow you to either run or open the simulation.  For now, choose the 
option that is labeled <b>Run Simulation...</b>. When you do, a window similar to 
the one below will appear. This new window tracks the progress of the simulation 
that you have requested to be run.  The progress bar will reflect the progress of 
the simulation, and when the simulation is complete, the EarLab Simulator window 
will close automatically.

After the simulation is complete and the EarLab Simulator window closes, you can 
use the ExperimentManager window to view the results of the simulation.  Click on 
the "+" sign next to the experiment, or double-click on the experiment name, and 
the window will look like this:

In this view, you can see some of the details that go into the experiment.  You 
can re-run the simulation by double-clicking where indicated, or you see a brief 
description of the experiment, you can view the Diagram and Parameter files which 
make up the simulation. You can also browse the input files used by the simulation 
and the output files produced by the simulation.  For now, open the <b>Output 
Directory</b> item, either by clicking on the "+" sign or by double-clicking on 
the item itself.  The window will now look like this:

Here we see three output files that have been produced by the simulation: NLBM, 
which is the output of the NonLinear Basilar Membrane module, IHC, which is 
produced by the Inner Haircell module, and AN, which is produced by the Auditory 
Nerve module.  For now, let's open up the <b>Auditory Nerve</b> output file, 
which you can do by <b>double-clicking</b> on it.  This will cause the EarLab 
DataViewer to be launched, with the Auditory Nerve output file opened.  For 
more help with the DataViewer, see the help available inside that application, 
available from the menu shown in the screen shot below:

<LI>Simulator<BR>
This software is fully functional and considered to be ready for release to the public
<LI>DataViewer<BR>
This software is fully functional and considered to be ready for release to the public
<LI>ExperimentManager<BR>
This software is a prototype only.  It uses information provided in the file<BR> 
"...\My Documents\EarLab\Runfile.xml".  This file has been hand-assembled for this
edition of EarLab.  In the future, we will provide automatic tools for generation of
this file or whatever happens to succeed it.
